# Keystone JARs

The [Keystone](https://github.com/davidbouchard/keystone) library comes with two JAR files, `jai_core.jar` and `keystone.jar`. You can download them through the Processing Development Environment's library manager. They live on your machine in a directory such as `/path/to/processing/libraries/keystone/library`.
